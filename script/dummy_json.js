If you live in the United States, then you're set to enjoy Memorial Day Weekend, the unofficial start to the summer. Hopefully, you've got some nice plans and you're able to see loved ones safely, which feels like an impossible luxury these days. To celebrate the end of the week, we collected some good posts because we enjoy doing that here. Have some laughs and soak some sun: Here are our nine favorite tweets of the week."

        "description" : "Photo dumps can include anything your heart desires. They allow you to post a selfie showing off your new haircut, a photo of a Chipwich you stress-ate over your laptop, a shot of your TV paused on a scene from Ted Lasso, the Louvre-worthy breakfast sandwich you ate two weeks ago, and a screenshot of a meme all at once. You can use dumps to illustrate a single event — such as a party or get-together with friends — but you can also use them to sum up entire days, weeks, months, or years of your life. I did the latter by posting a 2020 throwback photo dump to ring in the new year. It featured a post-cry Election Day selfie, my best quarantine meal, and a Cameo from Connie Britton. A real haul."

In fact, the blog was created on May 4, just one day before the Facebook Oversight Board was slated to announce a decision on Trump's suspension from its platforms. The Board upheld the suspension but kicked the ultimate decision down the road."

        "description" : "Let's all agree right now that asking someone what they 'got done' in 2020 is a dick move worthy of public shame. Over a year ago, we all went to sleep and the sun rose on a world much worse than the one we'd known the day before, so glibly asking what someone did after that is not really a small talk kind of question. Bo Burnham did something in quarantine, though, and he wants us to watch it. Or maybe he doesn't. Either way, his new Netflix special Bo Burnham: Inside is an amazing argument for why asking that question is loaded at best and emotionally horrifying at worst."
